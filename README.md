# HR Analytics Metrics Lab

This repository is a personal learning project by a people analytics practitioner exploring HR metrics in Python. The goal is to provide clear, step-by-step examples of calculating common HR metrics, helping others who are learning or experimenting with HR data.

## Why This Project?
HR metrics can be confusing, especially with formulas and real-world applications. This lab documents practical ways to calculate key metrics, with explicit code and logic, to serve as a reference for anyone who wants a full workflowâ€”not just the final numbers.

## Important Caution
Note: The formulas and methods shown here are illustrative. Organizations have their own definitions and business rules. Always review, adapt, and validate any metrics with HR or business stakeholders before using them for decision-making.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells in order.

## License
This project is for learning and demonstration only. Please validate all metrics and calculations with your HR or business stakeholders before applying them in practice.

*This repository is a work in progress. More notebooks and metrics will be added in the future.*
